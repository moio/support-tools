# Rancher v2.x profile-collector

## Notes

This script is intended to collect:
- [Golang profiles](https://github.com/pkg/profile) for [Rancher Manager](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/), and Rancher Cluster Agent
- Rancher debug logs
- Rancher audit logs when available
- Events from the cattle-system namespace
- metrics with kubectl top from pods and nodes


Output will be written to `/tmp` as a tar.gz archive named `<pod-name>-<date>.tar.gz`

## Usage

The script needs to be downloaded and run with a kubeconfig file pointed to the local Rancher cluster or a downstream cluster where cattle-cluster-agent pods are running
